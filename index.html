                    <p> I was born on Febuary 11, 1983 in San Francisco, California. I lived in San Francisco
                        for a few years until I moved to a city called Hercules where I spent the rest of my 
                        childhood/teen life. Growing up my hobbies were creating music, graphic designing, sports, snowboarding, and building things.
                        What stood out the most was my ability to create music, designing, and being athletic. 
                        After high school I then atteneded a junior college which didn't pan out the way I wanted it to,
                        so I decided to get full time job for few years until I decided to go to The Conservatory of Recording Arts and Sciences
                        in 2011.</p>

                    <p> After I graduated I interned at a professional studio called The Mix Room. After my intern 
                        I became a freelance audio engineer for a few years, however it wasn't finanically consistant,
                        so I wanted the change my career path. Being a creative and technical person, 
                        I wanted to try something new so I started my journey into becoming a full stack web developer.</p>
